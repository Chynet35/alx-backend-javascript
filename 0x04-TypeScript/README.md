# 0x04. Typescript

##  TypeScript is a special kind of language that helps us write code in a safer and more organized way. In regular JavaScript, we can write code quickly, but sometimes we make mistakes that can cause errors when we run our programs. TypeScript helps us catch these mistakes before we even run the code.

## One of the cool things about TypeScript is that it lets us define the types of our variables. A type is like a category that tells us what kind of value a variable can have. By using types, TypeScript can check if we're using the variables correctly. It also has other helpful features, like interfaces and classes. They allow us to describe the shape of our objects and define how they should behave. It's like having blueprints for building things.
