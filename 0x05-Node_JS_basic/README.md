# 0x05. NodeJS Basics

## Mastering these concepts below will empower one to proficiently work with Node.js, develop web applications, and streamline your development workflow.

## Run JavaScript with Node.js: Execute JavaScript code outside of browsers using Node.js.
## Use Node.js modules: Organize and import reusable code using modules with the require function.
## Read files with the fs module: Access and manipulate files using Node.js's built-in fs module.
## Access command line and environment: Utilize process.argv for command line arguments and process.env for environmental variables.
## Create a basic HTTP server: Use the http module to build a simple HTTP server for handling requests and responses.
## Build HTTP server with Express.js: Utilize Express.js, a Node.js framework, to create HTTP servers and define routes.
## Design advanced Express.js routes: Create specialized routes for various HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.) and incorporate middleware.
## Use ES6 with Babel-node: Employ ES6 features in Node.js by transpiling code with Babel for wider compatibility.
## Accelerate development with Nodemon: Boost efficiency during development by automatically restarting the server with Nodemon upon code changes.
